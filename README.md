I'm Sebastian, a Research Associate and Doctoral Student at the Department of Exercise Physiology and Sports Therapy at Justus Liebig University Gießen, Germany. 🌱 I recently discovered my passion for data science and visualization and am eager to enhance my technical expertise and research skills. 👀 Feel free to explore my public repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. 🫶🏻
